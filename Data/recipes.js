    instructions: 'Place water in a large saucepan with a little oil and salt. Bring to the boil and add fettucine. Stir for a few minutes to prevent fettucine from sticking together. Meanwhile, heat oil in a saucepan and gently cook onion, garlic and bacon on medium heat until onion becomes soft being careful not to burn. In a bowl beat the eggs. Pour in cream and whisk together. Add salt and pepper and mix well. Transfer cream mixture into saucepan (off the heat) with onion, garlic and bacon and stir quickly to combine. When pasta is cooked, drain into a large serving bowl and stir in the carbonara sauce and combine well. The heat of the pasta will cook the sauce and thicken. Serve immediately with some extra parmesan cheese.'
