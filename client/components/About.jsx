            <h3>Thanks for stopping by!</h3>

            <p class="about-text">I haven't always enjoyed cooking; often it seemed like a chore after work when I was tired
            and hungry children wanted food NOW... </p>

            <p class="about-text">After going gluten free in about 2004, I started to feel more interested in food. It didn't make
            me feel sick any more so the idea of cooking was much more appealing. That said, I've always enjoyed a nice dessert!</p>

            <p class="about-text">I hope you find a recipe here that inspires you to get into your kitchen and make something delicious.</p>
